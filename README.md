Dancers of all ages and levels or expertise regularly use mental imagery to better the outcome of their performance. As a part of the study conducted by Dr. Amit Abraham (Department of Physical Therapy, Ariel University) it was demonstrated that mental imagery training improves actual performance.




Although the advantages of this type of training, to date there is no system that provides trainees with accurate feedback and that quantitatively assess their level of precision in timing during the mental imagery process (aka chronometry), which is a key element for assessment of the mental imagery training and its beneficial effect.  

Our proposed project is designed to answer these gaps by collecting these data that will allow researchers and trainees alike to gain knowledge on precise participants were in the mental imagery process in regard to timing. We will build a platform that will measure and display quantitative outcomes of the mental imagery training.

Our program will include two types of users:
# Trainer

# Manage Exerices- add, edit or remove an exercise.

# Create new Trainee- Adding and remove a gymnast user to the system.

# Mannage Trainee -add, edit or remove an exercise and select several positions (standing, sitting, eyes opened/closed, break point, times etc.).

# Log report – The user(coach/researcher) will be able to download a report log/graph that shows the training statistics for each gymnast or all and makes a comparison between them.

# Trainee

# After the trainer add the trainee, she can log in into her account

two main ways of performing the training and measurement: Automatic and Manual: 

# Manual – the trainee sits with the coach/researcher and preforms the training with a clicker.
The user (Olympic gymnast, in our case) will be given an auditory cue ("buzzer”) that signifies the beginning and end of the imaged movement sequence.
Then, they will press a clicker (provided with the software) every time they mentally reach each of the agreed-upon points throughout the movement sequence. The program will record and save the exact time (millisecond-level precision) the user clicked and compare it to the pre-programmed desired time. At the end, the user will be able check if they were accurate with their judgement, and to what degree.

# Automatic – the user, on her own, preforms the training given cues by the system.
The user (Olympic gymnast, in our case) will be given an auditory cue ("buzzer”) that signifies the beginning and end of the imaged movement sequence. Next, the user will be imaging the whole movement sequence while given several auditory cues ("beep") to signify agreed-upon points throughout the sequence. That will allow the user to get online feedback about their self-perceived timing precision in comparison to the original timing (e.g., whether the user was accurate with their timing assessment or not). The system will keep track of the number of times the trainee trained.
